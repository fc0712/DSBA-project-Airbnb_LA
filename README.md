# Data Science Project of AirBnb in Los Angeles - DSBA course CBS

## Introduction and Research question
The global sharing economy is rapidly increasing, and in United States the number of adults engaging in a sharing economy
transaction is expected to reach 86.5 million by 2021 (eMarketer & Statista, 2017). Airbnb is one of the pioneers when
it comes to sharing economy businesses, and with its more than 800 million customers, it is one of the most successful
sharing economy platforms in the world (Airbnb, 2020a).

A common problem new Airbnb hosts are facing is determining the optimal price to charge for the apartment, house,
room etc. Simply comparing prices to listings in your neighborhood and basing prices on that will most likely not reflect
the ideal price. Thus, finding the optimal price for your Airbnb listing is a difficult and time-consuming activity. Setting
the price too high will result in a lack of booking and setting the price too low you will miss out on potential income.
Based on the described issue the following research question is derived:

 *‚ÄúIs it possible to predict the optimal listings price for new Airbnb listings?‚Äù*

 
To help answer above research questions and to ensure consistency in the project, the secondary research questions
will be answered throughout the project:
- What factors are important for renters when renting an Airbnb listing?
- Which attributes are the most significant determinants for the optimal listing price?


Above research will be based on the city of Los Angeles in the United States. Airbnb listings in Los Angeles has increased
exponentially in over the past year and Los Angeles is now one of the cities in the world with the most Airbnb listings
(Airdna & Statista, 2018a, 2018b). The main reason why our research is based on listings in Los Angeles is due to the
fact the Los Angeles does not have a center, unlike the majority of other popular Airbnb destinations, which makes the
city very unique.

## Conclusion
In order to answer the presented research questions extensive preprocessing of the Airbnb dataset took place, due to
the high number of missing values, which resulted in the main dataset being reduced from approximately 30,000 to
15,000 observations.

Natural Language Processing included sentiment analysis and topic modelling of Airbnb reviews data, which revealed a
predominance of positive reviews. A decomposition of the identified reviews sentiment indicated that positive and
negative reviews involved a lot of overlapping topics, among which place, location, bed and host were the most
frequent. Based on the implementation of NLP in the project, one particularly interesting factor identified was the fact
hosts appears to have a tremendous influence on renters satisfaction, and thus indicating that hosts need to be more
engaged compared to more traditional housing options such as hotels.

In order to predict the optimal listing price, different Machine Learning models were introduced. Based on a five fold
cross validation, the best performing Machine Learning model, and therefore the optimal model for the purpose of the
project, was found to be the Cat Boost model. Extensive hyper parameter tuning was performed on the Cat Boost model,
which improved model performance marginally and ensured robustness of the model.
A breakdown of the model performance revealed a ùëÖ2 value of 74.19 and a RMSE of 54.99, thereby indicating that the model is able to explain
74.19% of the variation in the listing price. Having the highest Shap values, the attributes bedrooms, price category
neighborhood, and bathrooms had the most significant impact the model performance, which makes sense, considering
the attributes bedrooms and bathrooms being indicative of the size of the listing. 

It can thereby be concluded that it is possible to predict an approximate optimal listing price for new Airbnb listings. Further optimization of the models
performance could however be achieved by implementing a Deep Learning model on listing photos, to capture the
overall attractiveness of the listings.
